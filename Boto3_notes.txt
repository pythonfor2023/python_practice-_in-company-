Using the AWS Common Runtime (CRT)
modular package help the AWS sdk extra for better Performance and minimal footprint 
Using the CRT, SDKs can share the same base code when possible
improving consistency and throughput optimizations across AWS SDKs.
pip install boto3[crt]
pip uninstall awscrt
pip install boto3[crt] :- re-enbleing 

Before using Boto3 SDK download the aws create the account
